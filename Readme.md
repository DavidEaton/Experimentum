**Case Sensitivity**: Verify that the case of all paths and filenames in the `ci.yml` matches the actual case in the Bitbucket repository.

By default, a build is triggered when a change is pushed to any file on any branch.

A _continuous integration (CI)_ build is a build that runs when you push a change to a branch.

A _pull request (PR)_ build is a build that runs when you open a pull request or when you push additional changes to an existing pull request.
