By default, a build is triggered when a change is pushed to any file on any branch.

A _continuous integration (CI)_ build is a build that runs when you push a change to a branch.

A _pull request (PR)_ build is a build that runs when you open a pull request or when you push additional changes to an existing pull request.

You can configure your build to run on specific branches, or to run only on pull requests.
